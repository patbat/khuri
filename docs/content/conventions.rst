Conventions
===========

Throughout the code, the following conventions apply:

* parameters like thresholds etc. are given in units of Mandelstam variables
* whenever an explicit choice of units is necessary (e.g. for the default
  parameters of phase parametrizations by the Madrid group), (powers of) GeV
  are used
